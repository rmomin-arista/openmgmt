This allows the use of certificates, signed by a recognized and trusted CA, for authentication to gNMI and other gRPC based services. By default only certificates signed with Arista's CA are trusted. In order to generate and sign certificates for mTLS authentication, an operator will need to install and configure a certifying authority (CA) that is used for signing certificates that are generated on network elements as well as the servers that will be interacting with the gRPC services. The necessary certificates for establishing the chain of trust will need to be imported into the switches and tools interacting with the switches. This document outlines the necessary steps to generate certificate signing requests (CSR) on arista devices, sign the certificates and import these into the switches. Process Overview Setup a private certificate authority (CA). This document uses easy-rsa Generate CSRs from the switch as well as for the host that will be initiating connections to the switch using mTLS as the authentication mechanism. Sign the CSRs using the CA tools. Copy the relevant elements to the switch (signed server certificate and CA certificate). Configure the switch to use the certificates and the associated CA certificate to perform mTLS authentication. Initiate connections from the clients to the switch to execute gNMI RPCs. Easy-RSA Setup The simple installation of Easy-RSA is well documented in the Easy RSA quick start guide . For a more durable installation you're encouraged to review the Easy-RSA documentation and customize the settings to your environment. Easy-RSA CA parameters easy RSA version: 3.0.8 As of this writing EOS only supports RSA certificates, this differs from the default configuration of Easy-RSA. The following variable in the vars file will need to be set in order to generate the appropriate certificate type. set_var EASYRSA_ALGO \"rsa\" Use the easyrsa build-ca command to create the necessary certificate signing infrastructure within easyrsa. This will generate a ca.crt certificate which can be imported into the PKI validation chain of the switches and other hosts in your PKI domain. This can also be used in a standalone manner with most gnmi clients. In our case, this CA certificate resides in: ${HOME}/easy-rsa/pki/ca.crt This will need to be imported into the network elements where you're using mTLS for authentication. Generate a Local Client Certificate This will be used by local clients (gnmi, gnoi, gribi, etc.) connecting to the switches in order to authenticate. Note the gnmi-client.cnf configuration file provided in the following openssl command is used to create the Subject Alternate Name IP address entry associated with the client certificate. This is optional and is not required for certificates. mkdir ~/gnmi-client-cert cd ~/gnmi-client-cert openssl req -out gnmi-client.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout gnmi-client.key -config gnmi-client.cnf The above commands will generate a private key as well as the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Sign the Local Client Certificate with Easy-RSA Note, that this is going to be a client certificate. As our gnmi client will be talking to the gnmi server on the switch. cd ~/easy-rsa ./easyrsa import-req ../gnmi-client-cert gnmi-client.csr gnmi-client ./easyrsa sign-req client gnmi-client The sign-req command generates the following output.

Useful Troubleshooting Commands show management api gnmi This command enables you to determine the operational state of the gnmi process as well as whether or not the ssl profile is considered valid. show management security ssl profile This command enables you to see the state of the ssl profiles and whether there are issues with the validation chain. Clocks and Certificate Lifetime Certificates should be created with a finite lifetime and rotated within that lifetime. However, if the clocks on the switch are grossly off this may impact certificate operation. Make sure that the clock on the switch is set correctly and synchronized to a reliable time source.

Conceptually, gNMI gateway sits as a proxy for multiple gNMI targets. A gNMI client speaks to a common gNMI service endpoint within the network (gNMI gateway) and specifies a gNMI target with an accompanying path. The gNMI gateway will in turn initiate the connection to the target device and stream the contents to the originating proxy. gNMI gateway documentation NANOG demonstration This demo will start the gNMI gateway binary and use gNMIC to stream to a target which is managed by the gNMI gateway. Please make adjustments to the targets.json file to match your environment. The demo is dependent on the following files: gnmi-gateway - The binary to activate gNMI gateway. This must be built for the platform that it will run on. Details regarding generation of the binary for the target platform can be found in the gNMI gateway documentation . server.crt / server.key - the certificate and key for gNMI gateway. These can be generated through a CA. Additional details may be found here . targets.json - This file specifies the targets. gNMI-gateway supports hot reloading of the files. So if changes are made within targets.json it will reload automatically with new targets and or new paths. sample: targets.json { \"request\": { \"default\": { \"subscribe\": { \"prefix\": { }, \"subscription\": [ { \"path\": { \"elem\": [ { \"name\": \"interfaces\" } ] } } ] } } }, \"target\": { \"DC2-SP02\": { \"addresses\": [ \"198.51.100.22:6030\" ], \"credentials\": { \"username\": \"ansible\", \"password\": \"ansible\" }, \"request\": \"default\", \"meta\": { \"NoTLS\": \"yes\" } }, \"DC2-LEAF1A\": { \"addresses\": [ \"198.51.100.5:6030\" ], \"credentials\": { \"username\": \"ansible\", \"password\": \"ansible\" }, \"request\": \"default\", \"meta\": { \"NoTLS\": \"yes\" } }, \"DC2-LF70\": { \"addresses\": [ \"198.51.100.70:6030\" ], \"credentials\": { \"username\": \"ansible\", \"password\": \"ansible\" }, \"request\": \"default\", \"meta\": { \"NoTLS\": \"yes\" } } } } EOS Configuration gNMI will need to be enabled on the target which is managed by gNMI gateway and a certificate will need to be installed to use TLS-based authentication.

Conceptually, gNMI gateway sits as a proxy for multiple gNMI targets. A gNMI client speaks to a common gNMI service endpoint within the network (gNMI gateway) and specifies a gNMI target with an accompanying path. The gNMI gateway will in turn initiate the connection to the target device and stream the contents to the originating proxy. gNMI gateway documentation NANOG demonstration This demo will start the gNMI gateway binary and use gNMIC to stream to a target which is managed by the gNMI gateway. Please make adjustments to the targets.json file to match your environment. The demo is dependent on the following files: gnmi-gateway - The binary to activate gNMI gateway. This must be built for the platform that it will run on. Details regarding generation of the binary for the target platform can be found in the gNMI gateway documentation . server.crt / server.key - the certificate and key for gNMI gateway. These can be generated through a CA. Additional details may be found here . targets.json - This file specifies the targets. gNMI-gateway supports hot reloading of the files. So if changes are made within targets.json it will reload automatically with new targets and or new paths. sample: targets.json { \"request\": { \"default\": { \"subscribe\": { \"prefix\": { }, \"subscription\": [ { \"path\": { \"elem\": [ { \"name\": \"interfaces\" } ] } } ] } } }, \"target\": { \"DC2-SP02\": { \"addresses\": [ \"198.51.100.22:6030\" ], \"credentials\": { \"username\": \"ansible\", \"password\": \"ansible\" }, \"request\": \"default\", \"meta\": { \"NoTLS\": \"yes\" } }, \"DC2-LEAF1A\": { \"addresses\": [ \"198.51.100.5:6030\" ], \"credentials\": { \"username\": \"ansible\", \"password\": \"ansible\" }, \"request\": \"default\", \"meta\": { \"NoTLS\": \"yes\" } }, \"DC2-LF70\": { \"addresses\": [ \"198.51.100.70:6030\" ], \"credentials\": { \"username\": \"ansible\", \"password\": \"ansible\" }, \"request\": \"default\", \"meta\": { \"NoTLS\": \"yes\" } } } }","title":"Overview"},{"location":"examples/gnmi-gateway/#eos-configuration","text":"gNMI will need to be enabled on the target which is managed by gNMI gateway and a certificate will need to be installed to use TLS-based authentication.

Models are structured representations of network elements and their associated configured and operational state. YANG (Yet Another Next Generation - RFC6020 ) is a data modeling language. YANG is used to describe the configured and operational state of network elements. This allows for the consistent and structured representation of device and protocol attributes. The model definition typically includes the low level data types used to represent operational attributes as well as constraints that should be enforced in configuration. These modeled representations provide a consistent mechanism for device configuration as well as validating the device state through streaming telemetry or other device interrogation methods. These modeled device representations can also be transformed into data structures that can be used by configuration systems to dynamically control device configuration or state. YANG has been adopted as the official modeling language of the IETF and the OpenConfig group. IETF models The for the past few years the IETF has been providing models for previously standardized technologies as well as protocols and technologies which are under active standardization. These models are commonly used with complementary IETF standardized network management protocols (e.g.: NETCONF and RESTCONF) and have been selectively incorporated into other modeling initiatives. OpenConfig models OpenConfig is an operator led group defining models for network devices. Their models have been widely adopted by a number of vendors including Arista and an ecosystem of open source tooling has emerged to utilize these models for telemetry and configuration applications. In addition to defining device and protocol models the OpenConfig group has defined complementary network management protocols which leverage these models for telemetry (gNMI), configuration (gNMI), operational activities (gNOI) and RIB manipulation (gRIBI). Though it bears noting that OpenConfig models can also be used with NETCONF and RESTCONF protocols as well. Details regarding the OpenConfig model support within Arista's EOS software can be found online. Vendor-Specific Models While standard models provide a wide range of feature coverage there is commonly a need to model vendor-specific device or feature operation. Examples of this may include device specific behaviors (hardware configuration details) or pre-standard functionality that is deployed in operator networks that needs to be managed using the same tooling. Vendors may opt to define all new models which are published independently. Alternately, vendors may choose to leverage an existing standardized model and add vendor-specific elements to the standard models these are known as model augments. These augments are commonly published to allow integration into operator tooling. Arista publishes augments associated with a given EOS release on GitHub .

It has a very flexible query language, can send alerts via alertmanager to various platform and can be integrated easily with many open-source tools. For more details and use cases, please visit https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/ . The purpose of this article is to show how easy it is to deploy and configure Prometheus and Grafana and configure Arista switches to send telemetry states to Prometheus using TerminAttr ( EOS streaming telemetry agent ) and one of the OpenConfig connectors that you can find on our official github page. Please note, that these apps were written as proof-of-concept and are supported on a best-effort basis. The projects can be forked and modified to suit your needs. Feedbacks are always welcomed and issues can be filed like for any other projects on github. Prerequisites The following tools will be necessary to be able to install Prometheus and Grafana, clone our project from github and compile ocprometheus. Homebrew (for macOS users) Go Git docker Installing Prometheus and Grafana There are several ways to install Prometheus and Grafana, the docker approach being the most popular and easiest. Installing Prometheus First, create a minimal Prometheus configuration file on the host filesystem at ~/prometheus.yml : vi ~/prometheus.yml Add your targets (network devices IP/hostname + port number) to the \u2018scrape configs\u2019 session Example prometheus.yml # my global config global: scrape_interval: 15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute. evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute. # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s). # Alertmanager configuration alerting: alertmanagers: - static_configs: - targets: # - alertmanager:9093 # Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'. rule_files: # - \"first_rules.yml\" # - \"second_rules.yml\" # A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape: # Here it's Prometheus itself. scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'prometheus' # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics' # scheme defaults to 'http'. static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9090'] - job_name: 'arista' static_configs: - targets: ['192.0.2.139:8080'] Start the Prometheus Docker container with an external configuration file: docker run -d \\ -p 9090:9090 -v ~/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \\ prom/prometheus \\ -config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml If the above doesn\u2019t work, check the latest docker command on the official Prometheus website . docker run \\ -p 9090:9090 \\ -v /tmp/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \\ prom/prometheus Add new targets In our case, targets are switches, but a target can be any type of device. By default if you are adding new targets by editing the prometheus.yml file on the host, it won\u2019t update the config file in the Docker VM, that is because every time you insert new characters with VIM and save the file, the inode will change. Option 1 Change the file permission to 664 ( rw-rw-r\u2013 ) chmod 664 prometheus.yml Check if the permissions have been changed ls -l prometheus.yml -rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 1076 May 14 12:25 prometheus.yml This will modify the file in your docker VM as well, but the configuration won\u2019t be updated until you restart the service, which you can do with a one-liner: sudo docker exec -i -t eager_kapitsa kill -HUP 1 Where eager_kapitsa is the name of the container, which you can find out with the docker ps command: root@tac-prometheus-ire:~# docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 47f52778b492 prom/prometheus \"/bin/prometheus --c\u2026\" 13 days ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:9090->9090/tcp eager_kapitsa 3e880f9a951e grafana/grafana \"/run.sh\" 3 weeks ago Up 3 weeks 0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp grafana You can always check if the configuration has been updated with the following curl command: root@tac-prometheus-ire:~# curl localhost:9090/config <ommited> static_configs: - targets: - 192.0.2.132:8080 - 192.0.2.139:8080 - 10.83.12.109:8080 - 192.0.2.138:8080 <ommited> Forum that explains this behavior . Option 2 NOTE If you don\u2019t want to change the file permission, you can use the :set backupcopy=yes option in VIM, which will make sure to not change the inode of the file when saving it. And restart the service again: sudo docker exec -i -t eager_kapitsa kill -HUP 1 Option 3 Use the \u2013web.enable-lifecycle flag when running the container. Installing Grafana You can use the following docker command to deploy Grafana in couple of seconds: $ docker run \\ -d \\ -p 3000:3000 \\ --name=grafana \\ -e \"GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL=http://grafana.server.name\" \\ -e \"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret\" \\ grafana/grafana Note: In newer versions of Grafana there are no more implicit volumes for /var/lib/grafana /var/log/grafana /etc/grafana For more details see what\u2019s new in Grafana 5.1 and later and recommended steps to migrate from older releases. There\u2019s also a ready-to-go combo of Prometheus/Grafana/docker-stack which you can find at https://github.com/vegasbrianc/prometheus (credit to Brian Christner) Now that we have Prometheus and Grafana running, we\u2019re ready to configure our switches and start drawing nice graphs from the queried data. Installing and configuring ocprometheus There are a couple of ways to install ocprometheus, and all require for you to compile it with GO. Git Clone the Arista GO library First you\u2019ll need to git clone the goarista repository. tamas:~ tamas$ git clone https://github.com/aristanetworks/goarista.git Cloning into 'goarista'... remote: Counting objects: 2584, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done. remote: Total 2584 (delta 1), reused 2 (delta 0), pack-reused 2574 Receiving objects: 100% (2584/2584), 945.38 KiB | 767.00 KiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (1529/1529), done. Checking connectivity... done. This will download all the files from that github page and we can then go ahead and compile ocprometheus. LPT In case the project you\u2019ve cloned has dependencies on other git project you can use the \u2013recurse-submodules flag while cloning which will also clone the submodules. E.g.: git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git://github.com/foo/bar.git Compile ocprometheus in GO 1. Go to your ocprometheus folder on your PC/laptop/server cd git/goarista/cmd/ocprometheus 2. Compile ocprometheus with the following paramethers: GOOS=linux GOARCH=386 go build 3. Copy the binary with SCP to the switch scp ocprometheus admin@192.0.2.139://mnt/flash Since EOS has a linux kernel, the OS has to be set to linux and the architecture to 32 bit (386) with GOOS and GOARCH variables respectively. Starting 4.22.0 we\u2019ve introduced a 64-bit EOS () and you can also compile ocprometheus for 64-bit architecture with the following command: GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build Option 1) Using the binary From this point you can just SCP the binary to a persistent storage on the switch (e.g. /mnt/flash/ ) and just configure the daemon and point it to /mnt/flash/ocprometheus Option 2) Install it as a swix You can also install it as a swix, which requires a bit more effort, however it\u2019s easier to manage swix packages, and you\u2019ll be able to see the ocprometheus extension in the show extensions output. In order to create a swix file, we first have to compile this binary as an RPM. Building RPMs can be tedious, especially for networking guys, who are not used to doing things like this. There are various tutorials online on how to use rpmbuild, but instead of wasting half an hour to create all the necessary folders and your spec file, etc we can create RPMs with just one line, using FPM (Effing Package Management). You can download FPM from the following github page: https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm ( credit to Jordan and all the people who contributed to this project \u2013 you\u2019ve made our lives easier! Thanks!) The following was done on a Devuan VM ( which is basically a lightweight Debian without systemd ) using the following steps: 1. Create a new folder: mkdir fpmbuild 2. Copy the compiled ocprometheus and the sampleconfig.yml (in this example it was renamed to ocprometheus.yml ) downloaded from github: cp ~/git/goarista/cmd/ocprometheus/ocprometheus /backup/fpmbuild/ cp ~/git/goarista/cmd/ocprometheus/sampleconfig_above_4.20.yml /backup/fpmbuild/ocprometheus.yml 3. Compile it with fpm: This one liner will create the RPM package without the need to create all the folders and specs that you\u2019d need to do with the usual rpmbuild: sudo fpm -s dir -t rpm -a all -n \"ocprometheus-$(date +%m_%d.%H%M)\" \\ -v1.5.6 --prefix /usr/bin/ \\ -C /backup/fpmbuild/ ocprometheus ocprometheus.yml Flags cheat sheet Flag Description -s dir Source is a directory -t rpm Target is an RPM file -a all User noarch instead of x86_64 -n \u201cocprometheus-$(date +%m_%d.%H%M)\u201c the name of the RPM -v 1.5.5 the version of the RPM will be 1.0 \u2013prefix /usr/bin/ The files will be installed in this directory -C /backup/fpmbuild/ ocprometheus ocprometheus.yml Change directory to here before searching for files 4. Copy the generated file to the switch and install it as a swix: root@devuan:/backup# ls -al ocpr* -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6462872 Jun 17 22:55 oocprometheus-06_17.2255-1.5.6-1.noarch.rpm root@devuan:/backup# scp ocprom* admin@ats323://mnt/flash/ 4.1. SSH to the switch and create the swix, e.g.: ssh admin@ats323 ats323...16:13:36# bash Arista Networks EOS shell [admin@ats323 ~]$ cd /mnt/flash [admin@ats323 flash]$ swix create ocprometheus-1.5.6.swix ocprometheus-06_17.2255-1.5.6-1.noarch.rpm adding: manifest.txt (stored 0%) adding: ocprometheus-06_17.2255-1.5.6-1.noarch.rpm (stored 0%) 4.2. Install it as a swix extension copy flash:ocprometheus-1.5.6.swix extension: extension ocprometheus-1.5.6.swix 4.3. Make it persistent across reloads copy installed-extensions boot-extensions 4.4. Check your extensions show extensions Name Version/Release Status Extension ------------------------------- -------------------- ----------- --------- TerminAttr-1.5.5-1.swix v1.5.5/1 A, I 25 ocprometheus-1.5.6.swix 1.5.6/1 A, I 1 A: available | NA: not available | I: installed | NI: not installed | F: forced Finally you\u2019ll need to copy the configuration file, which contains the subscription paths. You\u2019ll find the yaml file on our github page. You can find more details about subscriptions/metrics and how they are constructed in https://eos.arista.com/understanding-subscription-paths-for-open-source-telemetry-streaming For macOS it\u2019ll be similar with few modifications (tested on macOS Mojave and newer): 1. Install FPM and RPM brew install gnu-tar gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc fpm brew install rpm Note: on macOS Catalina you might need to use \u2013user-install when installing gem packages, and instead of \u2013no-rdoc use \u2013no-document . Xcode might need to be reinstalled if you\u2019ve upgraded from Mojave. e.g. gem install --no-document fpm --user-install 2. Similarly as before, create a folder from where you\u2019ll build your package and copy the compiled binary there mkdir fpmbuild cp ~/git/goarista/cmd/ocprometheus/ocprometheus ~/backup/fpmbuild/ cp ~/git/goarista/cmd/ocprometheus/sampleconfig_above_4.20.yml ~/backup/fpmbuild/ocprometheus.yml 3. Build the rpm with fpm using the following command sudo fpm -s dir -t rpm -a noarch --rpm-os linux \\ -n \"ocprometheus-$(date +%m_%d.%H%M)\" -v1.5.6 \\ --prefix /usr/bin/ -C ~/backup/fpmbuild/ ocprometheus ocprometheus.yml The only difference when using macOS to build your rpm using fpm is that you\u2019ll need to add the \u2013rpm-os linux flag, otherwise it\u2019ll build the rpm for OSX. Note: If you are using CVP and maintain your images and extensions with Image bundles, you\u2019ll have to add your ocprometheus.swix to Image bundles, otherwise they\u2019ll get removed during an image push operation. Now it\u2019s time to configure TerminAttr and ocprometheus. Sample EOS Configuration Here\u2019s a sample config for pre EOS-4.19 and post EOS-4.20.7M (CP-ACL) when using VRF MGMT ! vrf instance MGMT ! interface Management1 vrf forwarding MGMT ip address 192.168.58.16/24 ! system control-plane ip access-group def2 in ip access-group def2 vrf MGMT in ! daemon TerminAttr exec /usr/bin/TerminAttr -disableaaa -grpcaddr MGMT/0.0.0.0:6042 no shutdown ! daemon ocprometheus exec /sbin/ip netns exec ns-MGMT /usr/bin/ocprometheus -config /usr/bin/ocprometheus.yml -addr localhost:6042 no shutdown ! You\u2019ll need at least 3 things to configure ocprometheus: Location of the binary Location of the config file, configured by the -config flag gNMI socket of TerminAttr, which can be specified by the -addr flag TerminAttr is running a gRPC server locally on TCP 6042 , which you can check by looking at the logs: bash cat /var/log/agents/TerminAttr-`pidof TerminAttr` NOTE: when installing ocprometheus as a swix file, the binary will be put in /usr/bin directory by default (you can change that in the RPM making process). If you compile it in go and copy it to flash you can just change that daemon config to refer to that path (this way it won\u2019t be installed as a swix). e.g. daemon ocprometheus exec /sbin/ip netns exec ns-MGMT /usr/bin/ocprometheus -config /usr/bin/ocprometheus.yml -addr localhost:6042 no shutdown By default in EOS versions that have control-plane ACL we need to permit TCP port 8080 (default), or whichever port you decide to use to send data to the Prometheus server (defined in the targets list in prometheus.yml ) ip access-list def2 9 permit tcp any any eq 8080 10 permit icmp any any 20 permit ip any any tracked 30 permit udp any any eq bfd ttl eq 255 40 permit udp any any eq bfd-echo ttl eq 254 50 permit udp any any eq multihop-bfd 60 permit udp any any eq micro-bfd 70 permit ospf any any 80 permit tcp any any eq ssh telnet www snmp bgp https msdp ldp netconf-ssh gnmi 90 permit udp any any eq bootps bootpc snmp rip ntp ldp 100 permit tcp any any eq mlag ttl eq 255 110 permit udp any any eq mlag ttl eq 255 120 permit vrrp any any 130 permit ahp any any 140 permit pim any any 150 permit igmp any any 160 permit tcp any any range 5900 5910 170 permit tcp any any range 50000 50100 180 permit udp any any range 51000 51100 190 permit tcp any any eq 3333 200 permit tcp any any eq nat ttl eq 255 210 permit tcp any eq bgp any 220 permit rsvp any any To check if the port is open you can use netstat , e.g.: netstat -an | grep :8080 Or the network namespace command if VRF is used sudo ip netns exec ns-MGMT netstat -an | grep :8080 You should see a similar output as below: $ sudo netstat -tulnap | grep :8080 tcp6 0 0 :::8080 :::* LISTEN 17200/ocprometheus tcp6 0 0 172.28.160.232:8080 192.0.2.78:48956 ESTABLISHED 17200/ocprometheus Or in case of using a VRF: $ sudo ip netns exec ns-management netstat -tulnap | grep :8080 tcp6 0 0 :::8080 :::* LISTEN 12344/ocprometheus tcp6 0 0 192.0.2.139:8080 192.0.2.78:40820 ESTABLISHED 12344/ocprometheus Don\u2019t be confused if you see tcp6 in the output, that\u2019s expected, as AF_INET6 works for both IPv4 and IPv6 as per RFC 3493 . Note: The same configuration is used but no control-plane ACL for 4.20.7M > EOS >4.19 or in newer releases where EOS-PDP.swi is used, and you\u2019ll need to allow the Prometheus server IP using -allowed_ips=<IP/subnet> Here are some of the configuration combinations that you might have: No VRF and streaming to both CVP and Prometheus ! daemon TerminAttr exec /usr/bin/TerminAttr -ingestgrpcurl=192.0.2.33:9910 -cvcompression=gzip -taillogs -ingestauth=key,mysecretkey -smashexcludes=ale,flexCounter,hardware,kni,pulse,strata -ingestexclude=/Sysdb/cell/1/agent,/Sysdb/cell/2/agent -disableaaa no shutdown ! daemon ocprometheus exec /usr/bin/ocprometheus -config /usr/bin/ocprometheus.yml -addr localhost:6042 no shutdown !

The minimum required flags for TerminAttr are: disableaaa : Disable AAA checking \u2013 all AAA requests pass (in case username/password is not used in ocprometheus) grpcaddr string VRF and address to listen on to serve data using the gNMI interface. The expected form is [<vrf-name>/]address:port (default 127.0.0.1:6042 ) After configuring our switches we can head over to Grafana and start drawing our graphs! Creating dashboards in Grafana First you\u2019ll need to add Prometheus as a data source, to be able to graph streamed data to Prometheus. You can do this by using the following steps: 1. Go to Configuration (gear icon) / Data Sources 2. Add data source and select Prometheus 3. Fill out the form (add the URL for the Prometheus server e.g.: http://myprometheus.com:9090/ It should look like this: 4. Save & Test 5. Now we can create our dashboard ( + button on the left) 6. Add query 7. Make sure you have \u2018Prometheus\u2019 selected as Data Source After selecting \u2018prometheus\u2019 you will be able to add expressions like \u2018intfCounter\u2019 , \u2018tempSensor\u2019, etc. defined in the ocprometheus config yaml file. 8. After adding \u2018intfCounter\u2019 to the query, it\u2019ll start plotting the counters for all the interfaces and all the devices that Prometheus is polling 9. Save the dashboard Finally: you can add as many dashboards you want you can add more expression on a single graph you can choose one line on the graph and it will show the graph for only that line (e.g. in interface counters you can choose a specific interface to look at the counters for) How to graph data only for specific interface? We can add filters to the queries in both Prometheus console or in grafana, e.g. if I want to see data for interface Ethernet24 I\u2019d use the following filter: intfCounter{intf=\u201dEthernet24\u2033} You can filter based on any of the labels defined in the config file (some of them are unnamed, but you can add a name to those capturing/non-capturing groups inside the config file on EOS). Some of the paths contains capturing groups that are not named, and Prometheus will give them a name in the following format: unnamedLabelX For example, for interface counters on a 7160 device I have the following path: /Smash/counters/ethIntf/XpCounters/current/(counter)/(?P<intf>.+)/statistics/(?P<direction>(?:in|out))(Octets|Errors|Discards) From the above path you can see for example that the direction of the packets is captured in a named capturing group that also contains a non-capturing group: (?P<direction>(?:in|out)) Named capturing groups can be created with ?P<name> . We don\u2019t need to capture a separate group for in|out as we already do it with the named capturing group of direction, so we can use a non-capturing group with ?: Explanation: Named Capture Group: direction (?P<direction>(?:in|out)) Non-capturing group (?:in|out) 1st Alternative in in matches the characters in literally (case sensitive) 2nd Alternative out out matches the characters out literally (case sensitive) Match for inOctets will be divided like this: Match 1 Full match 0-8 inOctets Group `direction` 0-2 in Group 2. 2-8 Octets If we wouldn\u2019t use non-capturing group for in|out the result will be the following Match 1 Full match 0-8 inOctets Group `direction` 0-2 in Group 2. 0-2 in Group 3. 2-8 Octets Notice the extra group for matching in . Now for (Octets|Errors|Discards) there is no name defined, so the result will be Match 1 Full match 2-8 Octets Group 1. 2-8 Octets In this case since we used a capturing group by putting our strings/expression in a parenthesis, Prometheus will know that it needs to treat it as a separate label, so it gives it a name. If you don\u2019t want to see unnamedLabels you can add a group name similarly to the direction group. E.g. you can use the following expression: (?P<packetType>(?:Octets|Errors|Discards)) Result: Match 1 Full match 2-8 Octets Group `packetType` 2-8 Octets Pre-defined dashboard The open-source community is really helpful and thanks to Be Smart Be Open and Vista Technology we have a pre-defined grafana dashboard for Arista devices which you can find here: https://grafana.com/dashboards/10222 You can download the dashboard as a JSON file and then import it in Grafana. Some of the graphs that you\u2019ll find in this dashboard: Aggregated traffic Traffic by interface CPU & Temperature Power levels Voltage levels Interface counters for individual interfaces Beware of https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/6888 In case you have modular devices or multilane interfaces, you cannot use a variable to match those interfaces for example with intf=\"$interface\" because Grafana will escape special characters, even if they were already escaped by Prometheus (it\u2019ll escape it again). So instead of Ethernet3\\\\/2 you\u2019ll have Ethernet3\\\\\\\\/2 and no data will be plotted. The workaround is to use regex matching by putting the tilda ( ~ ) character after the equal sign. rate(intfCounter{job=\"$deviceType\",instance=\"$device\",intf=~\"$interface\",type=\"Octets\"}[1m])*8 You can also use regex matching like below rate(intfCounter{job=\"$deviceType\",instance=\"$device\",intf=~\"Ethernet(.*\\\\/.*)?(.*)?\",type=\"Octets\"}[1m])*8 Using rule records in Prometheus for EOS paths Rule records allow you to precompute frequently needed expressions and save the result as a new set of time series. Querying this result will be much faster then executing the original expression and very useful for dashboards, which need to query the same expression repeatedly. One example would be to use the /Kernel/proc/stat/<pid>/comm as a value label and store the metrics in a new time series for the other items under that path. For more details on rule records, please visit the best practices and the configuration section on the official Prometheus website. In my example I\u2019ve recorded a rule for the rss key under /Kernel/proc/stat/<pid>/ Here\u2019s what TerminAttr is streaming under /Kernel/proc/stat curl localhost:6060/rest/Kernel/proc/stat/1 Output: { \"cguestTime\": 0, \"cmajflt\": 4399, \"cmdline\": \"/sbin/init\", \"cminflt\": 511393, \"comm\": \"systemd\", \"cstime\": 3802, \"cutime\": 10380, \"delayacctBlkioTicks\": 0, \"endcode\": 135520894, \"exitSignal\": 17, \"flags\": 4219136, \"guestTime\": 0, \"kstkeip\": 4151638626, \"kstkesp\": 4292454672, \"majflt\": 31, \"minflt\": 10592, \"name\": \"1\", \"nice\": 0, \"numThreads\": 1, \"pgrp\": 1, \"policy\": 0, \"ppid\": 0, \"priority\": 20, \"processor\": 3, \"rlim\": 18446744073709551615, \"rss\": 1553, \"rtPriority\": 0, \"session\": 1, \"startcode\": 134512640, \"startstack\": 4292456144, \"starttime\": 2, \"state\": 83, \"stime\": 374, \"tpgid\": -1, \"ttyNr\": 0, \"utime\": 601, \"vsize\": 8925184, \"wchan\": 18446744071580351996 } In my example I\u2019ve used the \u2018rss\u2019 key and similarly you can create a record for each key. Here\u2019s how the sample config looks like: Ocprometheus.yml on EOS On the switch, the yml file should look like this (note that I\u2019ve deleted the other paths just for testing purposes). # Subscriptions to OpenConfig paths. subscriptions: - /Kernel/proc # Prometheus metrics configuration. # If you use named capture groups in the path, they will be extracted into labels with the same name. # All fields are mandatory. metrics: - name: kernelprocrss path: /Kernel/proc/stat/(?P<pid>.+)/rss help: KernelProcRSS - name: kernelproc path: /Kernel/proc/stat/(?P<pid>.+)/comm help: KernelProcStat valuelabel: command defaultvalue: 1 On the Prometheus server, you\u2019ll need to add a rules file and edit your prometheus.yml to specify the path to that file. Prometheus.yml on the server You\u2019ll need to create another yml file for the rules and mention it in the prometheus.yml file under the rule_files key. cat prometheus.yml Output: # my global config global: scrape_interval: 15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute. evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute. # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s). # Alertmanager configuration alerting: alertmanagers: - static_configs: - targets: # - alertmanager:9093 # Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the # global 'evaluation_interval'. rule_files: # - \"first_rules.yml\" # - \"second_rules.yml\" - \"kernel_rules.yml\" # A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape: # Here it's Prometheus itself. scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any # timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'prometheus' # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics' # scheme defaults to 'http'. static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9090'] - job_name: 'arista' static_configs: - targets: ['192.0.2.140:8080','198.51.100.21:8080','192.0.2.132:8080','192.0.2.139:8080','192.0.2.138:8080'] Kernel_rules.yml on the server groups: - name: test rules: - record: kernelprocrsswithcommand expr: kernelprocrss * on(pid) group_right kernelproc Note, if you did not mount the kernel_rules.yml file when creating your docker container (as I did) you\u2019ll need to copy the file over to your container with the following command docker cp kernel_rules.yml eager_kapitsa:/etc/prometheus/ Checking on the GUI, it will give you the following results You can also use the expression from the kernel_rules.yml directly on the GUI After you create the records and update the yml files on the server, make sure you can see the rule created in the Status \u2013 Rules submenu Using ocprometheus with the OpenConfig/OCTA agent (management api gnmi) While ocprometheus can subscribe to EOS native paths provided by TerminAttr\u2019s gNMI server on TCP 6042 (default, can be changed), it can also subscribe to OpenConfig paths provided by the OpenConfig/OCTA agent\u2019s gnmi server on TCP 6030 (default, can be changed). For example to subscribe to interface counters the subscription and the metric path would look like below: subscriptions: - /interfaces/interface metrics: - name: intfCounter path: /interfaces/interface\\[name=(?P<intf>[^\\]]+)\\]/state/counters/(?P<countertype>.+) OpenConfig and EOS native paths can be mixed when using OCTA and in that case the origin must be specified. Since the default origin is openconfig, the origin has to be only specified for EOS native paths under the subscriptions key, e.g.: subscriptions: - /interfaces/interface - eos_native:/Kernel/proc Note On EOS 4.23+ it's highly recommended to use OCTA with ocprometheus and only use eos-native paths where an openconfig model does not exist. Example configurations No VRF - gnmi/OCTA + ocprometheus management api gnmi transport grpc def provider eos-native ! daemon ocprometheus exec /mnt/flash/ocprometheus -config /mnt/flash/ocprometheus.yml -addr localhost:6030 -username admin no shutdown VRF - gnmi/OCTA + ocprometheus management api gnmi transport grpc def vrf management provider eos-native ! daemon ocprometheus exec /sbin/ip netns exec ns-management /mnt/flash/ocprometheus -config /mnt/flash/ocprometheus.yml -addr localhost:6030 -username admin no shutdown Cert-based authentification with ocprometheus Follow the steps mentioned in Certificate Authentification Configuration page . Copy the client certificate and client key to the /persist/secure/ssl and /persist/secure/keys directory respectively.

Troubleshooting tips Checking Logs and troubleshooting As any daemon/agent, logs are saved in /var/log/agents/ so we can either read those in bash with cat/more/less/vi/nano or from the CLI using the show agent logs command. Common issues Context_deadline_exceeded Seeing context_deadline_exceeded in the Targets section of the Prometheus GUI. This means connectivity is not established between the switch and the Prometheus server, which can be due to several reasons: TerminAttr and/or ocprometheus is not running TerminAttr and/or prometheus are not configured in the correct namespace/vrf Port 8080, which is used by default is not open on the switch (please check with netstat -an | grep 8080 or sudo ip netns exec ns-<vrf_name> netstat -an | grep 8080 if using a vrf; make sure the control plane ACL is updated and applied to vrf default or the specific vrf when using EOS version with CoPP Make sure TerminAttr is communicating with ocprometheus TerminAttr should have the -disableaaa flag added Not seeing any streams on Prometheus Check TerminAttr version (After TerminAttr 1.5.1 we replaced the deprecated gnmi.Value with gnmi.TypedValue ). This was only changed on our OpenConfig connectors (ockafka, ocprometheus, octsdb, ocredis, etc.) after March, 2019, thus older ocprometheus versions will ignore the updates. The version of ocprometheus that uses TypedValue as well was pushed to github on March 19th. A newer commit was done in the beginning of June to deal with coalesced deletes , and it\u2019s recommended to use the latest version. The best way to check if you are hitting any issues is to enable verbosity for ocprometheus with -v 9 ! daemon ocprometheus exec /sbin/ip netns exec ns-management /mnt/flash/ocprometheus -config /mnt/flash/ocprometheus20190319.yml -addr localhost:6042 -v 9 no shutdown ! In /var/log/agents/ocprometheus-<pid> you\u2019ll see error messages like below ( Ignoring incompatible update value ) : I0319 13:41:11.899488 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"vsize\" > > val:<json_val:\"4505600\" > I0319 13:41:11.899518 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"startstack\" > > val:<json_val:\"4289154048\" > I0319 13:41:11.899548 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"kstkesp\" > > val:<json_val:\"0\" > I0319 13:41:11.899578 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"exitSignal\" > > val:<json_val:\"17\" > I0319 13:41:11.899608 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"state\" > > val:<json_val:\"83\" > I0319 13:41:11.899638 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"cmajflt\" > > val:<json_val:\"0\" > I0319 13:41:11.899668 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"priority\" > > val:<json_val:\"20\" > I0319 13:41:11.899698 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"delayacctBlkioTicks\" > > val:<json_val:\"0\" > Make sure you\u2019re running the latest ocprometheus and TerminAttr versions. Broken paths due to incorrect regex Some of the subscription paths in the sample config file might not work on all type of devices. In case of broken paths, unfortunately we won\u2019t stream anything, and you might encounter a similar error as below when checking the metrics URL (http://x.x.x.x:8080/metrics) of a modular device: An error has occurred during metrics gathering: 17 error(s) occurred: * collected metric voltageSensor label:<name:\"sensor\" value:\"21\" > label:<name:\"unnamedLabel2\" value:\"voltage\" > gauge:<value:1.040771484375 > was collected before with the same name and label values * collected metric voltageSensor label:<name:\"sensor\" value:\"22\" > label:<name:\"unnamedLabel2\" value:\"voltage\" > gauge:<value:0.996826171875 > was collected before with the same name and label values * collected metric voltageSensor label:<name:\"sensor\" value:\"12\" > label:<name:\"unnamedLabel2\" value:\"voltage\" > gauge:<value:11.93359375 > was collected before with the same name and label values This can happen if the regexp matching is incorrect. The regexp path in question is: /Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/(?:cell/.+|system)/(?P<sensor>.+)/(voltage) This would match on VoltageSensorX , however if you check the list of voltage sensors using curl, you\u2019ll see that the sensors have the following format: VoltageSensorX/Y $ curl localhost:6060/rest/Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/cell/1/ { \"VoltageSensor1/12\": { \"_ptr\": \"/Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/cell/1/VoltageSensor1/12\" }, \"VoltageSensor1/13\": { \"_ptr\": \"/Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/cell/1/VoltageSensor1/13\" }, \"VoltageSensor1/14\": { \"_ptr\": \"/Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/cell/1/VoltageSensor1/14\" }, You can validate your regular expression using a regexp app (e.g www.regex101.com ): As you can see we are only matching VoltageSensorX To correct the issue, we can use the following path instead: /Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/(?:cell/.+|system)/(?P<sensor>VoltageSensor.+)/(voltage) As you can see, we are able to match on both VoltageSensorX and VoltageSensorX/Y . Authentication failed When you see the following message, it means that ocprometheus is not able to connect to the gRPC server that TerminAttr/OpenConfig/OCTA is serving, either because the disableaaa flag is not specified in the TerminAttr config (in case of using TerminAttr) or the username and password strings are incorrect in the ocprometheus config. cat ocprometheus-11069 ===== Output from /sbin/ip ['netns', 'exec', 'ns-management', '/mnt/flash/ocprometheus', '-config', '/mnt/flash/ocprometheus.yml', '-addr', 'localhost:6042'] (PID=11069) started Jun 17 11:27:35.313690 === F0617 11:27:35.449652 11069 main.go:90] rpc error: code = Unauthenticated desc = Authentication failed Connection refused You might see the following error: cat ocprometheus-10314 ===== Output from /sbin/ip ['netns', 'exec', 'ns-management', '/mnt/flash/ocprometheus', '-config', '/mnt/flash/ocprometheus.yml', '-addr', 'localhost:6042'] (PID=10314) started Jun 17 11:21:05.494319 === F0617 11:21:05.533516 10314 main.go:90] rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = all SubConns are in TransientFailure, latest connection error: connection error: desc = \"transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 127.0.0.1:6042: connect: connection refused\" When you get connection refused, it means that the gRPC server is not reachable.

In order to create a swix file, we first have to compile this binary as an RPM. Building RPMs can be tedious, especially for networking guys, who are not used to doing things like this. There are various tutorials online on how to use rpmbuild, but instead of wasting half an hour to create all the necessary folders and your spec file, etc we can create RPMs with just one line, using FPM (Effing Package Management). You can download FPM from the following github page: https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm ( credit to Jordan and all the people who contributed to this project \u2013 you\u2019ve made our lives easier! Thanks!) The following was done on a Devuan VM ( which is basically a lightweight Debian without systemd ) using the following steps: 1. Create a new folder: mkdir fpmbuild 2. Copy the compiled ocprometheus and the sampleconfig.yml (in this example it was renamed to ocprometheus.yml ) downloaded from github: cp ~/git/goarista/cmd/ocprometheus/ocprometheus /backup/fpmbuild/ cp ~/git/goarista/cmd/ocprometheus/sampleconfig_above_4.20.yml /backup/fpmbuild/ocprometheus.yml 3. Compile it with fpm: This one liner will create the RPM package without the need to create all the folders and specs that you\u2019d need to do with the usual rpmbuild: sudo fpm -s dir -t rpm -a all -n \"ocprometheus-$(date +%m_%d.%H%M)\" \\ -v1.5.6 --prefix /usr/bin/ \\ -C /backup/fpmbuild/ ocprometheus ocprometheus.yml","title":"Option 2) Install it as a swix"},{"location":"telemetry/adapters/ocprometheus/#flags-cheat-sheet","text":"Flag Description -s dir Source is a directory -t rpm Target is an RPM file -a all User noarch instead of x86_64 -n \u201cocprometheus-$(date +%m_%d.%H%M)\u201c the name of the RPM -v 1.5.5 the version of the RPM will be 1.0 \u2013prefix /usr/bin/ The files will be installed in this directory -C /backup/fpmbuild/ ocprometheus ocprometheus.yml Change directory to here before searching for files 4.

You can find more details about subscriptions/metrics and how they are constructed in https://eos.arista.com/understanding-subscription-paths-for-open-source-telemetry-streaming For macOS it\u2019ll be similar with few modifications (tested on macOS Mojave and newer): 1. Install FPM and RPM brew install gnu-tar gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc fpm brew install rpm Note: on macOS Catalina you might need to use \u2013user-install when installing gem packages, and instead of \u2013no-rdoc use \u2013no-document .

Some of the paths contains capturing groups that are not named, and Prometheus will give them a name in the following format: unnamedLabelX For example, for interface counters on a 7160 device I have the following path: /Smash/counters/ethIntf/XpCounters/current/(counter)/(?P<intf>.+)/statistics/(?P<direction>(?:in|out))(Octets|Errors|Discards) From the above path you can see for example that the direction of the packets is captured in a named capturing group that also contains a non-capturing group: (?P<direction>(?:in|out)) Named capturing groups can be created with ?P<name> . We don\u2019t need to capture a separate group for in|out as we already do it with the named capturing group of direction, so we can use a non-capturing group with ?: Explanation: Named Capture Group: direction (?P<direction>(?:in|out)) Non-capturing group (?:in|out) 1st Alternative in in matches the characters in literally (case sensitive) 2nd Alternative out out matches the characters out literally (case sensitive) Match for inOctets will be divided like this: Match 1 Full match 0-8 inOctets Group `direction` 0-2 in Group 2. 2-8 Octets If we wouldn\u2019t use non-capturing group for in|out the result will be the following Match 1 Full match 0-8 inOctets Group `direction` 0-2 in Group 2. 0-2 in Group 3. 2-8 Octets Notice the extra group for matching in . Now for (Octets|Errors|Discards) there is no name defined, so the result will be Match 1 Full match 2-8 Octets Group 1. 2-8 Octets In this case since we used a capturing group by putting our strings/expression in a parenthesis, Prometheus will know that it needs to treat it as a separate label, so it gives it a name.

The best way to check if you are hitting any issues is to enable verbosity for ocprometheus with -v 9 ! daemon ocprometheus exec /sbin/ip netns exec ns-management /mnt/flash/ocprometheus -config /mnt/flash/ocprometheus20190319.yml -addr localhost:6042 -v 9 no shutdown ! In /var/log/agents/ocprometheus-<pid> you\u2019ll see error messages like below ( Ignoring incompatible update value ) : I0319 13:41:11.899488 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"vsize\" > > val:<json_val:\"4505600\" > I0319 13:41:11.899518 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"startstack\" > > val:<json_val:\"4289154048\" > I0319 13:41:11.899548 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"kstkesp\" > > val:<json_val:\"0\" > I0319 13:41:11.899578 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"exitSignal\" > > val:<json_val:\"17\" > I0319 13:41:11.899608 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"state\" > > val:<json_val:\"83\" > I0319 13:41:11.899638 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"cmajflt\" > > val:<json_val:\"0\" > I0319 13:41:11.899668 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"priority\" > > val:<json_val:\"20\" > I0319 13:41:11.899698 5386 collector.go:77] Ignoring incompatible update value in path:<elem:<name:\"delayacctBlkioTicks\" > > val:<json_val:\"0\" > Make sure you\u2019re running the latest ocprometheus and TerminAttr versions.","title":"Not seeing any streams on Prometheus"},{"location":"telemetry/adapters/ocprometheus/#broken-paths-due-to-incorrect-regex","text":"Some of the subscription paths in the sample config file might not work on all type of devices. In case of broken paths, unfortunately we won\u2019t stream anything, and you might encounter a similar error as below when checking the metrics URL (http://x.x.x.x:8080/metrics) of a modular device: An error has occurred during metrics gathering: 17 error(s) occurred: * collected metric voltageSensor label:<name:\"sensor\" value:\"21\" > label:<name:\"unnamedLabel2\" value:\"voltage\" > gauge:<value:1.040771484375 > was collected before with the same name and label values * collected metric voltageSensor label:<name:\"sensor\" value:\"22\" > label:<name:\"unnamedLabel2\" value:\"voltage\" > gauge:<value:0.996826171875 > was collected before with the same name and label values * collected metric voltageSensor label:<name:\"sensor\" value:\"12\" > label:<name:\"unnamedLabel2\" value:\"voltage\" > gauge:<value:11.93359375 > was collected before with the same name and label values This can happen if the regexp matching is incorrect. The regexp path in question is: /Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/(?:cell/.+|system)/(?P<sensor>.+)/(voltage) This would match on VoltageSensorX , however if you check the list of voltage sensors using curl, you\u2019ll see that the sensors have the following format: VoltageSensorX/Y $ curl localhost:6060/rest/Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/cell/1/ { \"VoltageSensor1/12\": { \"_ptr\": \"/Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/cell/1/VoltageSensor1/12\" }, \"VoltageSensor1/13\": { \"_ptr\": \"/Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/cell/1/VoltageSensor1/13\" }, \"VoltageSensor1/14\": { \"_ptr\": \"/Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/cell/1/VoltageSensor1/14\" }, You can validate your regular expression using a regexp app (e.g www.regex101.com ): As you can see we are only matching VoltageSensorX To correct the issue, we can use the following path instead: /Sysdb/environment/archer/power/status/voltageSensor/(?:cell/.+|system)/(?P<sensor>VoltageSensor.+)/(voltage) As you can see, we are able to match on both VoltageSensorX and VoltageSensorX/Y .","title":"Broken paths due to incorrect regex"},{"location":"telemetry/adapters/ocprometheus/#authentication-failed","text":"When you see the following message, it means that ocprometheus is not able to connect to the gRPC server that TerminAttr/OpenConfig/OCTA is serving, either because the disableaaa flag is not specified in the TerminAttr config (in case of using TerminAttr) or the username and password strings are incorrect in the ocprometheus config. cat ocprometheus-11069 ===== Output from /sbin/ip ['netns', 'exec', 'ns-management', '/mnt/flash/ocprometheus', '-config', '/mnt/flash/ocprometheus.yml', '-addr', 'localhost:6042'] (PID=11069) started Jun 17 11:27:35.313690 === F0617 11:27:35.449652 11069 main.go:90] rpc error: code = Unauthenticated desc = Authentication failed","title":"Authentication failed"},{"location":"telemetry/adapters/ocprometheus/#connection-refused","text":"You might see the following error: cat ocprometheus-10314 ===== Output from /sbin/ip ['netns', 'exec', 'ns-management', '/mnt/flash/ocprometheus', '-config', '/mnt/flash/ocprometheus.yml', '-addr', 'localhost:6042'] (PID=10314) started Jun 17 11:21:05.494319 === F0617 11:21:05.533516 10314 main.go:90] rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = all SubConns are in TransientFailure, latest connection error: connection error: desc = \"transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 127.0.0.1:6042: connect: connection refused\" When you get connection refused, it means that the gRPC server is not reachable.
